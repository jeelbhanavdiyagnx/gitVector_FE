                Why Preserve Data After Removal?
            </p>
            <p>
                By retaining historical data after removal, GitVector ensures that teams can reference past performance, measure progress, and maintain consistent analytical insights. This approach balances the need for historical accuracy with the ability to discontinue future data processing.
